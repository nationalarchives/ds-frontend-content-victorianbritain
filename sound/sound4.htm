        went to the engineering part, which was very interesting. What used to 
        be done by hand and before took months to do is now done in a few seconds 
        by the most beautiful iron machinery. We saw first the new cotton machines 
        and the machine tools, which the engineering industry has made possible. 
        We saw pumping engines and machines for every possible purpose, from purifying 
        sugar, to extracting oil from linseed. We saw beautiful medals, which 
        are now produced by machinery in their millions. This is all most wonderful.'</font></b></i></font></p>
