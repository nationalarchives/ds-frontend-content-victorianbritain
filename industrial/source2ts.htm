            The list shows that there have only been two deaths caused by explosions 
            at mines at Washington, in the county of Durham and at Killington 
            in Northumberland.
            <p>I suggest that improving the ventilation in the mine would stop 
              the explosions caused by the build up of gases. At the Washington 
              mine, there are clear signs of bad management because workers were 
              still allowed to use candles until the explosion took place.</p>
            <p>At the Killington mine, poor ventilation resulted in a few small 
              fires. Therefore, the managers insisted on the use of safety lamps 
              instead of candles. Here, the explosion resulted from miners not 
              sticking to the rules.</p>
            <p>In both mines it would be possible to double the amount of ventilation. 
              The air shafts could be improved. Both mines were capable of producing 
              a ventilating current of nearly 30,000 cubic feet per minute.<br>
