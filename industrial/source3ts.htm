            It is hardly surprising from the report that there should be so many 
            deaths amongst boys working in the mine because of the different jobs 
            they do.
            <p>There are not many accidents in the shafts considering how deep 
              they are and the speed at which the cages travel up and down. This 
              shows how well the equipment is operated and looked after and the 
              value of the laws introduced to limit the number of miners being 
              pulled up at a time.</p>
            <p>Deaths caused by falls of coal and stone are few, considering the 
              depth of the mines and the use of wooden props to support the roof 
              whilst the coal is removed. The mine owners must be praised for 
              making sure that there is specific person responsible for getting 
              the wood and putting up the props, instead of leaving it to the 
              miners, as in other parts of the country.<br>
