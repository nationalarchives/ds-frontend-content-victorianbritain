            No.75 Ester Craven, aged 14: 
            <p>I have worked as a hurrier (pulling tubs of coal) for 5 years for 
              Mr. Joseph Ibbotson. I am not his apprentice. Mr. Foster pays my 
              wages. I like working down in the mine and would rather be here 
              than anywhere else. I prefer it to nursing and any other kind of 
              work. I can sew and mend if I have to, there is no one else to do 
              it for me as my mother died two years ago. I have a brother and 
              sister who are both hurriers and a younger one at home. My father 
              is a weaver. I usually start work at 7am and eat breakfast before 
              I get here and bring my lunch, a piece of cake, with me. When I 
              get home I have milk and porridge, sometimes potatoes. I do not 
              get home at a particular time, sometimes it is three, four, five 
              or six in the evening. When I work I wear short trousers and a corset. 
              The men never hurt us but Joseph Ibbotson often beats us, he was 
              beating my sister when you visited the mine and he beats all of 
              the boys. The other men tell him off for doing so. Whilst working 
              I often hurt my feet and graze my legs on the gates, I was once 
              struck by a pick and broke my finger. I cannot read or write, and 
              do not attend Sunday school a great deal as I have few clothes to 
              wear. I had a very bad mother, she left home and would not stay 
              with my father. For this reason I came to work in the mine with 
              my sister. It was my choice. Mother came to the pit &#8211;<br>
              head with a whip as I was going down, I quickly got out of her way. 
              Many a time I have regretted coming here, but I am used to it now 
              and think nothing about being beaten by the getters. </p>
            <p>No. 309 George Bentley:</p>
            <p>Age 8 years, has worked for a year and is paid a shilling a day 
              (5p). He lives in South Normanton and walks a mile and a half to 
              the pit each day. He has his breakfast before he leaves home. He 
              works full time from half past six in the morning to eight at night 
              with an hour for lunch on some days. He sometimes does three quarter 
              days from half past six in the morning until seven at night, and 
              half days from half past six in the morning until three or four 
              in the afternoon with no break for lunch. He does not work at night 
              or on a Sunday. He eats bread and dripping for breakfast, potatoes, 
              and occasionally has bacon, bread, and milk for his supper. He attends 
              the Ranter&#8217;s Sunday School to learn his alphabet. This boy 
              appears half starved, like the three others I spoke to. I visited 
              their homes and they were the poorest I witnessed.</p>

              No. 64 William Hollingsworth, aged 13</p>
            <p>I have no father or mother. My father was a shoemaker and died 
              five years ago, mother died eleven years ago. I lived with my sister 
              at Crossfield for six months and then went live in the workhouse. 
              In the parish of Halifax I became an apprenticed bricklayer to Joseph 
              Morton in the town of Southwram for two years until his death. A 
              coal miner called Jonathan Oldfield applied to the Board of Guardians 
              for an apprentice and I went to work for him on a month&#8217;s 
              trail. If I had remained with him I would have been bound to him 
              until I was 21years old. I only stayed for 5 days. He gave me porridge 
              for breakfast at five thirty in the morning and then I went with 
              two other apprentices with whom I slept, to work in the mine. We 
              took cake for our lunch but had no time to eat it. The first night 
              I worked in the pit, which was Thursday, we worked until ten. The 
              next night we finished at nine, then eight-thirty and then seven 
              forty-five. During that whole time we had nothing but the cake to 
              eat. We were not allowed to get a drink. I was really thirsty at 
              times. My master did not beat me, but he swore at me because I was 
              not quick enough with the baskets of coal. One day I pulled them 
              along without wearing shoes to go faster, but had to put my shoes 
              on again because I hurt my feet. The other apprentices told me that 
              they regularly worked until ten or eleven. I worked in Joseph Stock&#8217;s 
              pit and ran away because he worked me so late. I asked to go back 
              to the workhouse again. I would rather work if I had a fair master. 
              I have been to school and Sunday school and can read and write well.</p>
            <p>No. 8 John Bennet aged 14</p>
            <p>I started work here five years ago carrying coal and stones. We 
              have no horses in this mine. I cannot read or write. I go to Sunday 
              School at Pitshills. I never went to day school. I start work at 
              half past five and bring my breakfast with me. I finish at six in 
              the evening. We are allowed half an hour for breakfast and an hour 
              for dinner without fail. I am paid ten shillings a week (50p) and 
              I am in regular work nearby. My father is a banksman (man who loaded 
              men, boys and coal onto boats in the river) and my mother stays 
              at home. My father earns about a pound a week. I have seven brothers 
              and sisters, two of us work and the others have married or are in 
              service. Before I came here to Delph, I worked at Eli Hawley&#8217;s 
              at Burslem for a year, then Enrick Woods for two years ( running 
              moulds and turning jiggers?). If I was paid the same as a pit worker, 
              I would rather work running moulds because it is safer. I have seen 
              men killed by coal and roof falls. I have no fear of going up and 
              down in the mine. I have not seen any fires. I have enough tea, 
              bread, butter, bacon and potatoes to eat and have good clothes at 
              home. The people here do not beat me.</p>
