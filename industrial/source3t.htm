		<tr><td><br><br>The other accidents exhibited by the schedule, scarcely call for any remark, inasmuch as the vast number of persons (especially boys) employed at so many different occupations, which naturally with all care taken produce a series of accidental deaths.<br><br>

The accidents in the shafts are remarkably few, considering the rapid speed, with which the cages are moved, and the great depth of many of the shafts, and does but prove the excellence with which the apparatus is fitted up and maintained, and the great care taken of the people, at the same time I have frequently had occasion to cause regulations to be enacted, limiting the number of persons to be entrusted upon one slope for so regardless are the colliers of danger, that caution is not be expected of them.

<br><br>The deaths from falls of stone and coal are also very few considering the depth at which the mines are worked, and the constant attention required the system has been so generally adopted of taking away all the coal, whilst the roof is necessarily supported in a temporary manner by props, and in justice I must observe that great praise is due to North Country practice, of the owners becoming willingly responsible that proper person are employed to provide, and set the timbers instead of putting that responsibility upon the colliers as done in some other quarters of the country.<br><br>
