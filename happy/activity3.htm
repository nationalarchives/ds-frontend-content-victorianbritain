          to decide which of the statements below can be used to help explain 
          how the railways changed the lives of Victorian people. Click on the 
          statements that you think are true and then write in the number of the 
          sources that you think back up your choice. Check that you will be able 
          to provide evidence from the sources. Think about all of the sources 
          and what you have learnt from the earlier activities. </font></h3>
        <h3><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[N.B. The statements 
          that can be supported with evidence have the numbers of the appropriate 
          sources. The other statements have an explanation of why they are incorrect.]

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. All Victorians 
          could travel to foreign countries. Although source 5 shows that Victorians 
          had the opportunity to travel abroad, the clothes of the people in the 
          poster give the impression that only well off Victorians could afford 
          these trips. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B. The railway companies 
          encouraged people to visit different places. Sources 2 and 3 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C. Railways meant 
          that Thomas Cook could run his excursions. Source 5 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D. Sport was popular 
          in Victorian Britain. Sources 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E. Travelling to 
          actually watch sport was the only way to find out about it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although source 
          6 shows that large numbers of people watched football matches, Activity 
          1 mentions another way through which people found out about sport; the 
          newspapers. Railways did mean that newspapers were able to be distributed 
          quicker this meant you could find out the results of sporting fixtures 
          and events much quicker too. </font></p>
