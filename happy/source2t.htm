              APPROVED LODGINGS, of all classes, are provided in London for Passengers 
              by Midland Trains. The Agents will give Tickets of reference on 
              application, without charge, and an Office is opened in London, 
              at DONALD&#8217;S WATERLOO DINING ROOMS, 14 Seymour-street, near 
              Euston Station, where an agent is in regular attendance to conduct 
              parties who go up unprepared with Lodgings.<br>
              The Managers have much pleasure in stating that the immense numbers 
              who have travelled under their arrangements have been conducted 
              in perfect safety- indeed in the history of the Midland Lines, no 
              accident, attended with personal injury, has ever happened on an 
              Excursion train. In conducting the extraordinary traffic of this 
              Great Occasion the first object is to ensure safety, and that object 
              has hitherto been happily achieved.<br>
              With the fullest confidence, inspired by past success, the Conductors 
              have pleasure in urging those who have not yet visited the Exhibition, 
              to avail themselves of the present facilities, and to improve the 
              opportunity which will close on 11th October.<br>
              All communications respecting the Trains to be addressed to the 
              Managers, for the Company,<br>
              John Cuttle &amp; John Calverley, Wakefield;<br>
              Thomas Cook, Leicester.<br>
              October 2nd, 1851.<br>
