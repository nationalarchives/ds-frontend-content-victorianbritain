      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">The 
        Victorian age was the greatest period of the railways in Britain. The 
        railways almost completely wiped out all other forms of transport and 
        made long distance travel possible for large numbers of people for the 
        very first time. Every town of any importance was linked by the national 
        network, however many smaller towns were not connected.</font> </p>

  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>&#160;</td><td colspan="2" height="193"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">This 
      meant that people could, for the first time, live miles away from their 
      places of work. Around London, suburbs began to develop for the first time 
      and people travelled up to twenty miles in to London to work every day. 
      Colonel Charles Sibthorp, who was a great opponent of the Crystal Palace, 
      was also opposed to the development of railways. However, he dropped his 
      opposition when he realised that it would be possible for him to travel 
      to and from his constituency in Lincoln much more quickly. <br>
      But people could also travel in the opposite direction and for the first 
      time seaside resorts began to flourish. In the past, places like Brighton 
      had only been for the wealthy, from the mid-nineteenth century more and 
      more people were able to enjoy the delights of the seaside and a great British 
      tradition was created.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;
