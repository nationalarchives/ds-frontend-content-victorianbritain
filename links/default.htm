        Child Labour Simulation A historical simulation on child labour. Each 
        student is given the name of a person involved in the debate over the 
        issue of children working in textile factories in the early part of the 
        19th century. The characters are divided into eight different categories: 
        Factory Owners: Supporting Child Labour, Factory Owners Opposing Child 
        Labour, Campaigners Against Child Labour, Supporters of Child Labour, 
        Doctors Opposing Child Labour, Doctors Supporting Child Labour, Child 
        Workers: Girls and Child Workers: Boys. Each student then used the Internet 
        to discover details of their character and their views on child labour. 
        Each student writes a brief biography of their character and prepares 
        a speech for a debate entitled: &quot;Parliament should pass legislation 
        making it illegal for children under the age of twelve to work in textile 
        factories.&quot;</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.workhouses.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.workhouses.org.uk/</a><br>
        A useful site giving information about the workhouse, conditions, education, 
        buildings, and locations in Britain. The site also uses a lot of photographs.</p>

        From the collections at Tiverton Museum, the site covers a number of themes 
        which allow you to explore original Victorian artefacts. All of the 
        objects were used by people in Victorian times and from them we can learn 
        something about how these people lived. </p>
