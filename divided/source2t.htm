            But now mark the effect of the system on women: it causes a total 
            ignorance of all domestic duties; they know nothing that they ought 
            to know; they are rendered unfit for the duties of women by overwork, 
            becoming utterly demoralized. In the male the moral effects of the 
            system are very sad, but in the female they are infinitely worse, 
            not alone upon themselves, but upon their families, upon society, 
            and, I may add, upon the country itself. It is bad enough if you corrupt 
            the man, but if you corrupt the woman, you poison the waters of life 
            at the very fountain. Sir, it appears that they are wholly disqualified 
            from even learning how to discharge the duties of wife and mother.<br>
