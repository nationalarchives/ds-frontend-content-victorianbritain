            In the West Riding, it appears, girls are almost universally employed 
            as trappers and hurriers, in common with boys. The girls are all ages, 
            from seven to twenty-one. They commonly work quite naked down to the 
            waist, and are dressed- as far as they are dressed at all- in a loose 
            pair of trowsers. These are seldom whole on either sex. In many of 
            the collieries the adult colliers, whom these girls serve, work perfectly 
            naked. Near Huddersfield, the sub-commissioner examined a female child. 
            He says,
            <p> &#8220;I could not have believed that I should have found human 
              nature so degraded. Mr Holroyd, and Mr. Brook, a surgeon, confessed, 
              that although living within a few miles, they could not have believed 
              that such a system of unchristian cruelty could have existed.&#8221;</p>
            <p> Speaking of one of the girls, he says</p>
            <p> &#8220;She stood shivering before me from cold. The rug that hung 
              about her waist was as black as coal and saturated with water, the 
              drippings of the roof.&#8221; &#8220;In a pit near New Mills,&#8221; 
              (says the sub-commissioner) &#8220;the chain passing high between 
              the legs of two girls, had worn large holes in their trowsers. Any 
              sight more disgustingly indecent or revolting can scarcely be imagined 
              than these girls at work. No brothel can beat it.&#8221;<br>
              Sir, it would be impossible to enlarge upon these points; the evidence 
              is<br>
            </p>
