            <br>
            &#8220;I strongly disapprove of females being in pits; the female 
            character is totally destroyed by it; their habits and feelings are 
            altogether different; they can neither discharge the duty of wives 
            nor mothers. I see the greatest difference in the homes of those colliers 
            whose wives do not go into the pits&#8221;
            <p>&#8220;One reason why women are used so frequently in the coal-pits 
              is, that a girl of twenty will work for 2s. a day, or less, and 
              a man of that age would want 3s. 6d. It makes little difference to the coal master; he pays the 
              same whoever does the work. Some would say he got his coal cheaper, 
              but I am not of that opinion; the only difference is, that the collier 
              can spend 1s. to 1s 6d. more at the alehouse.&#8221;<br>
