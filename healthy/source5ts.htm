            <br>
            Sir, 
            <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter, and now send 
              you a petition from the people of Ormskirk that has been signed 
              by 164 ratepayers requesting the adoption of the terms of the Heath 
              of Towns act. According to the last rate book the number of ratepayers 
              was over 1100, so it is clear that people are very keen to adopt 
              the new law, indeed, more would have signed, but it seemed unnecessary 
              to add their names to the list.</p>
            <p>I have put off sending the petition in the hope that the Epidemic 
              Disease Act and the order of the Commissioners might have helped. 
              However, I realise there is no power in law to deal with the Irish 
              lodging houses which have become quite a problem in our town as 
              Liverpool is not far away.</p>
            <p>The people of the town want sewers and a sufficient water supply. 
              It is impossible to carry out any effective health reforms without 
              them. In the meantime, it is vital that you send us a health officer. 
              As Chairman of the Sanitary Committee (working under the Poor Law 
              Guardians) I will be Healthy to publicise the plans for a health officer 
              and would be glad to help him in his work. Perhaps you will let 
              me know if he will conduct his own inquiries or expects the people 
              of the town to provide him with information.</p>
            <p>Yours faithfully,<br>
            </p>
