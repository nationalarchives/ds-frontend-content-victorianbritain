	  Sir<br><br>
            The highly inadequate and improper state of the temporary hospital 
            appropriated for the relief of Cholera Patients in the Township of 
            Gateshead, having been reported to the Central Board of Health with 
            an assertion that five children were actually placed in one bed, and 
            three in another bed in that hospital, I am directed by the Board 
            to require that you will state with as little delay as possible every 
            circumstance connected with such want of humanity, which if founded 
            in truth must prove highly disgraceful to the members of that Board.<br><br>
