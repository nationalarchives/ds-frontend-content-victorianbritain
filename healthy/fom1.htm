        1842 Edwin Chadwick published his 'Report on the Sanitary Conditions of 
        the Labouring Population of Great Britain'. He had surveyed different 
        areas around the country and calculated the average life expectancy of 
        people from different classes and areas. The results were startling to 
        say the least. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">Chadwick 
        claimed that people living in the countryside lived far longer than people 
        in towns. He compared Rutland, a rural county with no large towns, with 
        the new industrial cities of the north. </font> </p>

        report led to the setting up of a Royal Commission and then to the Public 
        Health Act of 1848. He became one of the Commissioners. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000"> Unfortunately 
        many people found Chadwick rather rude and he often provoked opposition. 
        In 1854 he was forced to retire. This letter was sent to 'The Times' to 
        explain why he was unpopular. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">' We 
        prefer to take our chance with cholera than be bullied into health. There 
        is nothing a man hates so much as being cleansed against his will or having 
        his floor swept, his hall whitewashed, his dung heaps cleared away and 
        his thatch forced to give way to slate. It is a fact that many people 
        have died from a good washing.' </font></p>

        Snow</font></b></font> <font color="330000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1813-1858)</font><br>
        <font color="330000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 
        Snow was the eldest son of a farmer and born at York on 15th March 1813. 
        He was educated at a private school in York until the age of fourteen, 
        when he was apprenticed to a surgeon living at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He worked 
        as surgeon in the mines and later as unqualified assistant during the 
        cholera epidemic of 1831-2. Snow continued his medical training in London. 
        In October 1838 he became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, 
        having been admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England 
        in May 1838. He graduated as an M.D. of the University of London on 20 
        December 1844, and in 1850 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College 
        of Physicians.</font></p>
      <p><font color="330000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Snow's 
        great breakthrough theory was that cholera spreads through means of an 
        impure water supply. He outlined his ideas in an essay about the communication 
        of cholera which was published in 1849, and awarded a prize by the Institute 
        of France. In 1855 a second edition was published, with a much more detailed 
        investigation into the water supply in certain districts of South London 
        during in the epidemic of 1854. </font></p>
      <p><font color="330000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Snow 
        was also interested in the properties of ether, then newly adopted in 
        America as an anaesthetic. He made great improvements in the method of 
        giving patients the drug. He obtained permission to demonstrate his results 
        in the dental out-patient room at St. George's Hospital surgery which 
        was highly successful. Nevertheless, Snow appreciated the value of other 
        anaesthetizing drugs, notably chloroform. He gave this to Queen Victoria 
        on 7 April 1853, during the birth of Prince Leopold, and again on 14 April 
        1857 at the birth of Princess Beatrice. Snow died unmarried on 16 June 
        1858, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery</font>.<br>
