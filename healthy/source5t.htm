            <br>
            Sir,<br>
            I am obliged for your attention to my letter and now beg to forward 
            Petition
            praying for the adoption of the Health of Towns Act from the Inhabitants 
            of
            Ormskirk signed by 164.The number of rated Inhabitants by the Cast 
            rate Book is upwards of 1100 so that it will be perceived that it 
            is signed by a number exceeding the required amount. There appears 
            to be a very favorable feeling towards its adoption generally and 
            many more signatures might have been obtained but it was thought unnecessary. 
            I shall feel greatly obliged by its presentation. I have deferred 
            forwarding the Petition in the hope that the
            enforcement of the Epidemic disease Act and the Order of the Commissioners
            might have answered our purpose but perceiving that there is no apparent
            available power of dealing Summarily with Irish Lodging Houses which 
            have become from our proximity to Liverpool quite a pest to the town it 
            will avail little as a permanent remedy. The town wants Sewering too 
            and an ample supply of water without which no efficient Sanatory measures 
            can be carried out. The attendance of an officer as early as practictable 
            is earnestly requested in the meantime. I will as Chairman of the 
            Sanatory Committee under the directions of the Guardians work out 
            the order of the Commissioners as far as practicable shall be glad 
            to give all publicity to the intention of the officers attendance 
            to make the necessary inquiry and shall be glad of any information 
            to enable me to assess him his inquiries. Perhaps you will intimate 
            whether the surveying officer will make the necessary inquiries for 
            himself or he will expect the inhabitants to be prepared with evidence 
            for his consideration.
            <p>I am, Sir, Yours very Obediently,<br>
            </p>
			Ormskirk, 15th October, 1848
            <br>
