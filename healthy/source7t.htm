            <br>
            To the honourable<br>
            The General board of Health<br>
            The humble petition of the owners of property and ratepayers of the 
            Township<br>
            Ormskirk in the county Palatine of Lancaster.<br>
            That your petitioners strongly object to the introduction of the public 
            health Act<br>
            into Omskirk aforesaid in the following grounds, i.e.
            <p>On account of the very great expense and burden it will be to the 
              inhabitants<br>
              generally and which they are unable to bear.</p>
            <p>That there is a sufficient supply of good and pure water in the 
              town, in so much that some of the town's pumps and wells have been 
              removed and rendered useless.<br>
              <br>
              That your petitioners are fully convinced that the Nuisance removal 
              and disease Acts of 1848 and 1849 are quite sufficient without the 
              addition of the Public Health Act. If the local board will appoint 
              a fit and proper person to inspect Nuisances, all nuisances in the 
              town will immediately disappear.</p>
            <p>That Ormskirk is only 13 miles from Liverpool and a great number 
              of poor Irish<br>
              have come from there to Ormskirk in a dying state, and this accounts 
              for a great number of deaths.</p>
            <p>That your petitioners are prepared to prove that the town of Ormskirk 
              is<br>
              one of the cleanest towns in Lancashire and also one of the most 
              healthy.</p>
            <p>That the evidence taken by Mr Rawlinson with respect to the insufficient 
              supply of water, is totally false, and which you petitioners are 
              prepared to prove.That the evidence taken by Mr Rawlinson as to 
              filthy state of streets and footpaths etc. is also false and can 
              be proved by any number of witnesses.</p>
            <p>That the petitioners are firmly of the opinion that certain parties 
              have signed a<br>
              petition to introduce the board of health act into the town who 
              are not ratepayers and which may be easily proved by referring to 
              the rate books.That a number of ratepayers who signed the petition 
              were induced to do so in<br>
              consequence of the misrepresentations of certain parties and they 
              (ratepayers) are now anxious to withdraw their signatures, and a 
              number of them have actually done so by signing the present petition.</p>
