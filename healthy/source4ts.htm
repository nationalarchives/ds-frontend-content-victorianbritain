            My Lord
            <p>When I wrote to you in August I referred to the cholera epidemic 
              of 1832 and how I would like to offer my suggestions based on what 
              I witnessed, which might help support the laws concerning cholera.</p>
            <p>The worst outbreaks of cholera took place in ports and towns built 
              on marshy land, near rivers and canals. These places had impure 
              water supplies. Those places in the nearby hills seemed to avoid 
              the disease.<br>
              This was particularly true in France, which saw a high death rate 
              in Calais, St Pierre, Guines and St. Omer, but the surrounding countryside 
              avoided any deaths from the disease.</p>
            <p>Those parts of the city of Bristol built on marshy ground and near 
              the River Avon, had a large number of cases, yet those areas on 
              higher ground and with a better water supply, remained free from 
              cholera.</p>
            <p>Doctors and scientists now generally agree that cholera is not 
              contagious. Inhaling bad air does not result in the disease. In 
              my opinion it results from stagnant water that has been infected 
              by impure air. The poorer classes have the highest death rate because 
              they drink this water.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, the same places will be affected by cholera, as in 
              1832, if there is no improvement made to their water supply. Bad 
              smells and impure air will cause typhoid and fever, but will not 
              cause the spread of cholera.<br>
            </p>
