            Precautions Against Cholera.
            <p>The advanced scientific information of the day shows that Cholera 
              and Fever are as capable of being prevented as that once fatal malady 
              the Small-pox. By the introduction of Vaccination, the latter complaint 
              has been driven from amongst the higher and more intelligent classes 
              of the community. Cholera (that new plague) can also be prevented 
              by proper sanitary arrangements. This dreadful pestilence has for 
              the third time visited our shores; on two former occasions, it has 
              gone nearly over the same ground; it then seized on those places 
              remarkable for their ill-judged position, or from the great neglect 
              of means of cleanliness, adequate to extent and progress of the 
              population.<br>
              <br>
              Since the last visitation of Cholera, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Gateshead 
              have made but little improvement in their condition, the numbers 
              of persons have increased, particularly amongst the poor. The houses 
              in many instances are so peculiarly placed that the one catches 
              the refuse of the other. The river Tyne is even polluted with filth 
              and without entering into distressing particulars, these towns were 
              in 1853 the ready vehicle to convey this scourge once more to England. 
              The pestilence has passed over its regular course. Who can say if 
              Newcastle had been put into a proper state of defence to meet the 
              enemy which will sweep away many thousands, this island might not 
              have altogether escaped the visitation. The Plague, before the Fire 
              of 1666, found constant harbour in London, and spread itself in 
              different directions. After the Fire it only slightly attacked the 
              metropolis and was speedily banished from the country. <br>
              <br>
              We do not mean to state that the disease so fearfully known by the 
              ...</p>
            <p>...them and their families in a wholesome manner, at a small yet 
              remunerating cost. <br>
              <br>
              A worse sanitary state of things could not well be than that in 
              the neighbourhood of the Coal-yard Drury-Lane.<br>
              <br>
              Here are from sixteen to eighteen large families living in small, 
              inconvenient apartments above cow sheds, donkey and horse stables, 
              &amp;c. Sometimes many cartloads of refuse are allowed to remain 
              in the yard; the pavement is uneven, and filled here and there with 
              stagnant water. It is shocking to see the squalid children attempting 
              to play in such a place and yet this place is within a stone's throw 
              of the spot on which the Great Plague broke out, as may be seen 
              by reference to the Parish-clerk&#8217;s Reports, the Diaries of 
              Evelyn and Pepys, and De Foe's Account of the Plague.<br>
              <br>
              To the miserable condition of this filthy place, called &#8220; 
              King's Arms yard&#8221;, attention has been lately called. The residences, 
              in a sort of gallery, are ranged about what has been one immense 
              rotting dung heap. Some efforts have been made to improve its condition; 
              and there has been carted out of it a mass of decomposed filth, 
              the stench of which was scarcely endurable. Close to this spot the 
              approach to which from Drury-lane has now appropriately enough, 
              a coffin maker's shop on each side, the Great Plague of 1665 broke 
              out; and here neglect, ignorance, and laissez fair prepare the way 
              for a fresh pestilence. Most deeply it to be regretted that at such 
              a time as the present men should be found to lend the weight of 
              an official position to obstruct endeavours to obtain improvement 
              in the neglected portions of this two sided metropolis, instead 
              of giving their earnest aid, as they should do, in furtherance of 
              them.<br>
