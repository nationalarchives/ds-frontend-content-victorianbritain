      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of this exhibition 
        of National Archives materials is to encourage students to look critically 
        at documentary evidence of the past; to investigate and challenge interpretations 
        and views of the past; and to reach balanced conclusions based upon the 
        evidence.<br>
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The exhibition is 
        divided into eight sections. <br>
        The first is an introduction, which focuses upon the Great Exhibition 
        of 1851.<br>
        There then follow six galleries, each of which focuses upon an area of 
        public life during the Victorian period. In each of these galleries, students 
        are required to investigate an aspect of Victorian life by considering 
        a key question.</font> <br><br> </td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A timeline, which

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further background

        be used?<br>
        </b> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These are some suggestions 
        for using the material contained in the exhibition.<br>
        </font> <br>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students could make 
        use of the exhibition as part of their programme of study in Key Stage 
        3, concentrating on certain galleries. For example Unit 22: The Role of 
        the Individual for good or ill: Section 4 which explores the impact of 
        the life of an individual would be useful for a study of Lord Ashley, 
        Edwin Chadwick and Sir Robert Peel within the galleries &quot;Industrial&quot;, 
        &quot;Caring&quot; or &quot;Divided&quot; Nation. The &#8220;Find out 
        More&#8221; section of each of these galleries also provides more information 
        on these people.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exhibition as 
        a whole supports those Key stage 4 GCSE syllabuses covering aspects of 
        British Social and Economic History and the Schools History Project section 
        on the history of medicine with regard to &#8220;Healthy Nation&#8221;. 
        For those courses covering the Suffragette Movement and the demand for 
        the vote, the gallery &#8220;Divided Nation&#8221; could be used as an 
        introduction to the position of women in the mid nineteenth century.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For younger pupils 
        at Key stage 2, selective use of material and sources could be made to 
        support unit 11: What was it like for children living in Victorian Britain?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of helping 
        to meet the ITC requirement for history, the sources could be linked to 
        other websites or web pages and used to create an individual web page 
        for an investigation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Finally, it is possible 
        to use many of the sources in isolation or they could be &#8220;book-marked&#8221; 
        to form part of a scheme of work.</font></p>
