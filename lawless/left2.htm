        cost a shilling, or five pence. About 4,500,000 people came on these 'shilling 
        days'. These were working people, who came from all over Britain.<br>
        The first 'shilling day' was expected to lead to a great deal of trouble. 
        One MP, Colonel Sibthorpe warned that there would be crime and disorder.<br>

      someone's pocket of anything worth one shilling (5p) or more and stealing 
      anything worth £2.00. Sir Robert Peel abolished almost all of the capital

      to put the emphasis upon preventing crime, rather than punishing criminals. 
      Some of the novels of Charles Dickens, who was writing in the 1830s and 
      1840s, show how lawless the streets of British cities could be.In 'Oliver 
      Twist' Fagin runs a gang of pickpockets, and Bill Sykes is a violent and 
      dangerous criminal. In 'Great Expectations', Pip is befriended by the convict 
      Magwitch, who had escaped from a hulk. </font></td>

      that the new police should not be like the military and therefore great 
      care was taken to ensure that police constables did not look like soldiers. 
      <br>
      This is why peelers wore top hats instead of helmets and carried truncheons 
      instead of rifles, although cutlasses were available for emergencies! </font></td>

      the police were extended as more and more laws were passed. For example
