            &quot;Warehouses mostly become the spoil of the Burglar, they being 
            for the most part made fast outside, where from the presence of valuable 
            property, a guard is left on the premises; a plant is put upon the 
            place - the guard is observed to go to some neighbouring pot house 
            to take his pipe and pint of beer in the evening. The plant is continued 
            - it is soon discovered what time the watchman leaves his trust and 
            when he returns. This point gained an opportunity is taken to fit 
            the lock. A piece of steel, the shape of a key, coated with wax, tallow, 
            or blackened by the flame of a candle is introduced into the lock. 
            Upon the coating, the impressions of the ward are imprinted and in 
            this way, should the skeletons they have in hand not answer the purpose, 
            a key is soon formed - three or four fittings may be required. Enabled 
            to gain admittance, the next step is to lag a plant upon the guard; 
            for this purpose one of the party, possessing &quot;the gift of the 
            gab&quot; is chosen and sent to the house frequented by the guard, 
            sometimes a few nights before, but always on the night of the intended 
            robbery. He tells a good tale, sings a song, is noticed by, or notices 
            his man, an acquaintanceship is soon formed, he vouches the guard 
            is the kindest and most convivial fellow in the World, feigns drunk, 
            insists upon the other drinking at his expense. Let it suffice, he 
            keeps the
            poor watchman engaged 'till the signal is given by his confederates 
            that all is
            right, when he takes his departure, leaving a shilling for another 
            for his dupe, thus making certainty doubly sure.&quot;
