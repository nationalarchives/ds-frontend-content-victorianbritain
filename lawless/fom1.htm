      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">At 
        the beginning of the nineteenth century there were only two police forces 
        in Britain. One was the Bow Street Runners, which was a detective force 
        that had been set up in 1749; the other was the City of London Police 
        Force, which had been set up in 1798. In the remainder of the country, 
        law and order was in the hands of the local magistrates, who could enlist 
        special constables or call in the army. In local villages there could 
        be Parish Constables or night-watchmen. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">The 
        Metropolitan Police Force was set up in 1829 by the Home Secretary Sir 
        Robert Peel. He had already set up a police force in Ireland in 1822. 
        There were 2,800 officers headed by two commissioners. As well as being 
        called 'Peelers', they were also known as 'Bobbies'. <br>
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000"> The 
        early days of the Metropolitan Police Force were not very good. Of the 
        first 2,800 recruits, 2,328 were dismissed from the force for breaking 
        regulations. <br>
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000"> In 
        1842 a plain clothes branch was set up with eight members. This aroused 
        great public opposition. There were many protests that it would be unfair 
        to have policemen out of uniform, as the public would be unable to identify 
        them. But eventually the Criminal Investigation Department was established 
        in 1878.</font>
