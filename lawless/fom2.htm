      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
        the eighteenth century prisons were often run privately and warders charged 
        the inmates for food and other services. Extra payments could also lead 
        to separate rooms, and frequent visitors. Wealthy prisoners could live 
        almost as well in prison as they could outside.<br>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But for the 
        poor, the situation was very different. Prisoners were squashed into rooms, 
        which could hold fifty or more people. There was no hygiene and typhus, 
        known as jail fever, was widespread. <br>

    <td colspan="2" height="172"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      first attempts to reform prisons came in the 1770s when John Howard, a magistrate, 
      visited prisons and then passed an Act of Parliament that led to warders 
      being paid a salary rather than charging fees. Elizabeth Fry, who campaigned 
      to improve prison conditions, began to visit Newgate Prison in the early 
      nineteenth century and her efforts led to the setting up of Holloway prison 
      for women.<br>
      </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the most 
      important changes in prisons came in the middle of the nineteenth century, 
      when a new design of prison was introduced. This was called the 'separate 
      system'. Here prisoners were kept in separate cells in wings radiating out 
      from one central block. This enabled the warders to keep an eye on the prisoners 
      as easily as possible.</font> </td>
