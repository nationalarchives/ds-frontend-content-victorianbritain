            Huddersfield Workhouse Horrors.
            <p>Scandal at Andover nothing in comparison!</p>
            <p>Last Monday, an important parish council meeting of the ratepayers 
              of Huddersfield took place in the town&#8217;s Guildhall. The crowded 
              hall was attended by some of the most important people of the town. 
              The meeting had been called by the Overseers of the poor to discuss 
              with the ratepayers of Huddersfield, the health and general treatment 
              of the poor. The overseers listed below have been charged by the 
              ratepayers to carry out an inquiry into the treatment of the poor 
              at Huddersfield workhouse. The charges made to the Poor Law authorities 
              suggest worse cruelties than were found at Andover. Further information 
              on the medical relief in the town has been given by Mr T.R. Tatham, 
              whom for last four years has been standing up for the poor and the 
              interests of the ratepayers. Therefore, the overseers feel it is 
              necessary to call a meeting of the ratepayers to discuss the facts 
              of the case so steps can be taken to repair the damage done to the 
              town&#8217;s reputation.</p>
            <p><br>
              Overseers&#8217; Report</p>
            <p><br>
              The overseers of the town of Huddersfield having received their 
              instructions from a ratepayers meeting to set up an inquiry into 
              charges concerning the sick and poor in Huddersfield workhouse now 
              present their report.</p>
            <p>The overseers heard the evidence of the Medical Officer for the 
              Northern division of the town, where the workhouse is situated and 
              several nurses who have looked after the poor in the workhouse and 
              the fever hospital. They have also made inquiries at the workhouse 
              itself. They have reached the conclusion that the poor have been 
              treated very badly. They are still without clothing or bedding and 
              have been forced to remain in the most terrible state. Patients 
              have been forced to remain for 9 weeks without a change of bedding. 
              New patients have repeatedly had to use beds previously occupied 
              by patients who have died of typhoid. These beds were mere bags 
              of straw or wood shavings, swarming with lice, and placed on the 
              floor. Patients suffering from infectious fevers were constantly 
              forced to sleep in the same bed. It was not unusual for a patient 
              to be sharing a bed with somebody whom been dead for some time. 
              For months they have not had properly assigned nurses looking after 
              them. Male paupers look after female patients. The sick have been 
              left in a shameful state, having to remain unwashed, often covered 
              in their own excrement. Drugs ordered by the doctor have frequently 
              been withheld. In the fever hospital, where patients&#8217; lives 
              depended on the consumption of wine, supplies were lacking for 48 
              hours at a time. According to the medical officer this increased 
              the death rate amongst the patients.<br>
