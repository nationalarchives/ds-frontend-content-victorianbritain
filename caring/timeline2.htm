          relief was provided by parishes. Each parish appointed two 'Overseers', 
          who collected poor rates from the ratepayers and then used the money

          A Royal Commission was set up to investigate the Poor Law. <br>
          <br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1834</b> 
          The Royal Commission published its report.<br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Poor Law 
          Amendment Act was passed. <br>
          The Act abolished all existing systems for giving poor relief and forced 
          all parishes to form unions and build Union Workhouses. Rules for workhouses 
          were published and all Unions had to follow them. These included the 
          meals that the poor were to be given, work, education of children, the 
          wearing of uniform, splitting up of families and many others. Workhouses 
          were to offer a standard of living lower than anything available outside. 
          This was called 'less eligibility'.<br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The able-bodied 
          poor had to go into a workhouse if they needed relief; this was called 
          'indoor relief'. But Unions could give 'outdoor relief', especially 
          to the old, the sick and young children. <br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Act was 
          based upon the belief that poverty was caused by laziness, and that 
          the best way to tackle the problem was to make the consequences of poverty 
          so unpleasant that people would do anything to avoid going into the 
          workhouse.<br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At first the 
          Act was only applied to the south of England, where it worked reasonably 
          well.<br>

          The New Poor Law, as it came to be known, was introduced in the north 
          of England. This proved much more difficult. In the northern industrial 
          towns the whole workforce could be unemployed whenever there was a slump 
          in trade. It was impossible to find room for all the poor in the workhouses.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>1842</b> The 
          Poor Law Commission introduced the 'Labour Test'. This allowed able-bodied 
          men to be given work outside the workhouse if there was no room for 
          them inside.<br>

          Andover Scandal revealed some of the worst aspects of the New Poor Law. 
          At the Andover Workhouse the inmates had been forced to fight for bones 
          and gristle.<br>

          Charles Booth, a wealthy ship-owner, began a survey of the poor in London. 
          His results were published in 1901. He showed the extent of deprivation 
          that existed in the poorest districts of the capital.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><br>
          1899</b> Seebohm Rowntree began a survey of the poor in York. He proved 
          that poverty was hardly ever caused by laziness. He found that in 52% 
          of the cases in York, it was caused by low pay. Rowntree's report was 
          a major factor in the decision of the Liberal government to introduce 
          the first stage of the Welfare State in the years from 1906.<br>
          </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nevertheless, the 
          Poor Law remained in force throughout the nineteenth century. Workhouses 
          did not finally disappear until the Poor Law was abolished in 1929.
