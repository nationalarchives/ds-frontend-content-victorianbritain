            Mr Pigott<br>
            2
            <p>London, <br>
              22nd December 1855</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, <br>
              I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 
              20th instant, in which you inform me that having had under consideration 
              the expediency of some further provision than now exists for the 
              Dietary of Young Children Workhouses between the ages of two and 
              nine years, you ask my opinion as to the expediency of dividing 
              this class for the purposes of diet into two and as to what measures 
              may be advisable to secure to the children in workhouses the kind 
              and quality of food to their respective ages.</p>
            <p>In reply, I have no hesitation in stating my opinion that the present 
              system by no means secures this important object; that the discretion 
              as regards the younger children, is very imperfectly exercised to 
              the great prejudice of their health and to unnecessary waste of 
              food, and that the modification of the existing practice proposed 
              in the letter of the poor Law Board is highly desirable. I venture 
              however to suggest that in place of leaving the preparation of the 
              Dietaries for Children between two and nine years of age to the 
              Guardians conjointly with the Workhouse Medical Officer, the later 
              should be required to submit such Dietary as he thinks proper to 
              the Board of Guardians and that they should transmit the same to 
              the Poor Law Board, with such observations as they may desire to 
              make thereon.</p>
            <p>I take the opportunity of adding my opinion of the desirableness 
              (whilst establishing this classification) of insisting in every 
              workhouse on the formation of a district Nursery Class, under the 
              charge of a competent female for the custody and the care throughout 
              the day of all of the children under six years of age, in a wood 
              floored room, well warmed and ventilated, where they may have their 
              meals under the new regulation. This practice prevails in some workhouses 
              with most beneficial result to health of the children and to the 
              discipline and order of the workhouse. Mothers having children at 
              the breast are allowed to resort to them at all times and have them 
              with them also in their dormitories at night. The children are thus 
              kept clean and out of harm&#8217;s way during the day, and have 
              their meals as regulated by the medical officer.</p>
            <p>In the workhouses where nurseries are not provided (which composes 
              by far the greater number), the children are constantly with their 
              mothers, often young single mothers, who makes them a pretext for 
              evading their due share of the labours of the house; preventing 
              due cleanliness and especially at mealtime, having them upon their 
              laps, and supplying them with portions of their own food, unsuited 
              to the digestive functions of infants, whereby the mortality amongst 
              this class becomes often very formidable, this mortality being increased 
              also in many instances by the cold brick or stone floors of the 
              Able Women&#8217;s day wards. A further evil consequence of the 
              absence of regular nurseries is the practice of putting young infant 
              bastards in the charge of young girls of fifteen and sixteen years 
              old, whilst the mothers are at work, who having continual resort 
              to the children are thus brought into the closest contact and most 
              continual communication with those from whom they ought to be most 
              carefully separated.</p>
            <p>Lastly for want of these Nurseries children of 4 or 5 years are 
              often placed in the female school, to the prejudice of the older 
              children, by undue diversion of the attention of the teacher and 
              often to the permanent injury of their own health by a premature 
              exertion of their nervous system.</p>
            <p>I have the honour to be, <br>
              My Lords and Gentlemen<br>
              Your very obedient servant, </p>
            <p>Grenville Pigott<br>
              Poor Law Inspector<br>
              Place with the other answers<br>
