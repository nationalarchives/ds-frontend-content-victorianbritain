            To the Chairman of the Board of Guardians of the Huddersfield Union<br>
            Huddersfield, June 1847.<br>
            Sir,<br>
            I am sorry to have occasion again to remark on the state and management 
            of the Fever<br>
            Hospital. It is my wish at all times to avoid complaints, but really 
            when I find affairs of that establishment carried on in a slovenly 
            and inefficient manner, from incapacity and negligence of the nurses 
            appointed to take care of the sick, -I am constrained to give such 
            a statement of facts, as I hope will induce you to remedy the evil 
            for the future - Robert Worth is the only nurse in that Hospital who 
            can read and write for a week or two he did his duty; He then became 
            ill of a fever and was confined to bed a fortnight, since that fever 
            he seemed to be disgusted by his occupation and is become reckless. 
            This man with the help of another man, named Mark Bradley are the 
            only individuals I have seen to attend upon the sick of both Male 
            and Female patients, -I have never seen a woman assist in the female 
            wards those who have to make calls of Nature. Besides I have seen 
            three individuals lying in their own Filth with the hands and faces 
            smeared with it too whole days without being washed. The Names are 
            <p>Benjamin Carr.. .died on the 6th June<br>
              James Till...died on the 15th June<br>
              Bridget MacLoughin.. .died on the 18th June</p>
            <p>The regular administration of Medicine prescribed and attention 
              to those Patients who are too weak to feed or help themselves are 
              very much neglected. I will here remark that, when a Patient arrives 
              at a certain state of weakness and debility, as much depends upon 
              good nursing as Medicine. It therefore becomes extremely painful 
              as Medical Officer to find my efforts frustrated by the omission 
              of other adjustments I have so much experience in the early and 
              present period of my Professional career as Medical Officer to Parish 
              Hospitals as to be fully convinced of the utter worthlessness of 
              Pauper Nurses unless superintended by a proper paid nurse.</p>
            <p>Hoping that due attention will be paid to these remarks</p>
            <p>I am Sir<br>
              You Obedient Servant<br>
              Thomas Robert Tatham<br>
