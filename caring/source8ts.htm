            <br>
            Thank you for the letter of the 20th in which you tell me of the need 
            to make some changes to the daily diet of children aged between 2 
            and 9 years. I have no hesitation in my answer to your question about 
            splitting this group into two and how to provide workhouse children 
            with the appropriate type of food.
            <p>In my opinion, the present system has not settled this matter. 
              As far as the younger children are concerned, their health is often 
              damaged and food often wasted. Therefore, the Board&#8217;s proposals 
              are very welcome. I would also like to suggest that instead of leaving 
              the preparation of the daily diet to the Guardians and the workhouse 
              medical officer, the latter should be required to make his suggestions 
              and give them to Board of Guardians and they can send them to the 
              Poor Law Board with their comments.</p>
            <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to point out about the 
              need, whilst talking about splitting age groups, of the need to 
              set up a nursery class in every workhouse. This would be under the 
              care of a trained female who would be responsible for all those 
              children under the age of six. They would have all of their meals 
              in a warm, well ventilated room with a wooden floor. Workhouses 
              that have these nurseries have benefited as result from healthier 
              children and improved discipline. Mothers are allowed to feed their 
              babies at all times and have them with them at night in the dormitories. 
              As a result, the children are kept clean and safe during the daytime, 
              and their meals are controlled by the medical officer.</p>
            <p>In workhouses where there are no nurseries, a great many in fact, 
              the children are often with their mothers. These mothers are often 
              single and use the child as an excuse for getting out of work. They 
              prevent cleanliness by having their children on their laps at mealtimes. 
              The mothers also feed their children food from the table and this 
              is highly unsuitable for babies. Indeed, this is often a cause of 
              death. The death rate of these young children is increased by the 
              instance of cold stone or brick floors in the female wards. Another 
              dreadful result of the lack of nurseries is the practice of putting 
              the children of single women in the care of 15 or 16 year old girls 
              whilst the mothers are at work. This means that these girls are 
              in continual contact with the very people with whom they should 
              avoid.</p>
            <p>Finally, lack of nurseries for children of 4 or 5 years often means 
              that they are sent to the girl&#8217;s school. This has a bad effect 
              on the older children because the teacher has to concentrate on 
              the younger children which is often damaging to their own health 
              and mental state.</p>
            <p>I am honoured to your obedient servant, <br>
              Lords, and Gentlemen<br>
            </p>
