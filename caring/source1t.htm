            Huddersfield Workhouse Abominations<br>
            Andover In The Shade
            <p>On Monday evening last, a most important vestry meeting of the 
              parish ratepayers of the Huddersfield township was held in the Guildhall 
              of that town, attended by a most attentive and crowded auditory, 
              among whom were a considerable number of the most influential inhabitants. 
              It had been convened by the overseers of the poor for the purposes 
              and in the manner set forth in the following notice:-</p>
            <p>Medical relief and general treatment of the sick poor.- To the 
              ratepayers of the township of Huddersfield.- The undersigned, being 
              overseers of the poor, having had in its charge by the ratepayers 
              in vestry assembled to institute a searching inquiry into the manner 
              in which the sick are, and have been, treated in the Huddersfield 
              workhouse, and having ascertained that charges have been duly made 
              to the poor-law authorities, which in cruelty and disgrace surpass 
              even the facts that earned for Andover such an unenviable notoriety; 
              and having, moreover, learned the facts connected with the question 
              of medical relief for the township, as exemplified in the extremely 
              hard case of Mr. T.R. Tatham, who for the last four years has been 
              fighting the battle of the poor against niggardliness and parsimony, 
              and standing up for the true interest of the ratepayers against 
              real extravagance and short-sightedness, deem it incumbent on them 
              to call the ratepayers together, in open vestry, that the facts 
              of the whole case may be made known, and such steps taken as may 
              be deemed most fitting to wipe away the disgrace that will otherwise 
              indelibly attach to the township.</p>
            <p><br>
              OVERSEERS&#8217; REPORT</p>
            <p>The overseers of the poor of the township of Huddersfield, having 
              received it in instruction from a vestry meeting of the township 
              (assembled on the 23rd day of March last, to nominate fit and proper 
              persons to fill the said office of overseers), to institute an inquiry 
              into certain allegations then and there made, as to the general 
              treatment the sick poor had received in the Huddersfield workhouse, 
              beg to say that they have complied with the request contained in 
              the resolution of the said vestry meeting, and have thereupon to 
              report as follows:-</p>
            <p>The overseers have had before them the medical officer of the northern 
              division of the township, (in which district the workhouse is situated), 
              and also several of the parties who have acted as nurses to the 
              sick poor, both in the workhouse and in the temporary fever hospital. 
              They have also made it their business to prosecute certain inquiries 
              at the workhouse itself; and the result of all is that, that they 
              are forced to the conclusion that the sick poor have been most shamefully 
              neglected; that they have been and still are devoid of the necessary 
              articles of clothing and bedding; that they have been suffered to 
              remain for weeks at a time in the most filthy and disgusting state; 
              that patients have been allowed to remain for nine weeks altogether 
              without a change of linen or of bed clothing, that beds in which 
              patients suffering in typhus have died, one after another, have 
              been again and again and repeatedly used for fresh patients, without 
              any change or attempt at purification; that the said beds were only 
              bags of straw and shavings, for the most part laid on the floor, 
              and that the whole swarmed with lice; that two patients suffering 
              in infectious fever, were almost constantly put together in one 
              bed; that it not unfrequently happened that one would be ragingly 
              delirious, when the other was dying; and that it is a fact that 
              a living patient had occupied the same bed with a corpse for a considerable 
              period after death; that the patients have been for months together 
              without properly appointed nurses to attend to them; that there 
              has been for a considerable time none but male paupers to attend 
              female patients; that when the poor sick creatures were laid in 
              the most abject and helpless state- so debilitated as to pass their 
              dejections as they lay, they have been suffered to remain in the 
              most befouled state possible, besmeared in their own excrement, 
              for days together, and not even washed; that the necessary stimulants 
              ordered by the medical officer have been withheld; that when patients&#8217; 
              lives even depended on the free administration of wine, the fever 
              hospital has been left without for more than forty-eight hours at 
              a time; that death occurred amongst the patients from which such 
              stimulant was withheld, which the medical officer attributes to 
              this very cause; that the party whose duty it was to have provided 
              such wine, was repeatedly applied to for it, both by the nurses 
              at the hospital and the medical officer.<br>
