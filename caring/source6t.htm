          <td><b>This part of a letter sent from the Reigate Union to an Assistant Poor Law commissioner. His job was to inspect the Unions in his area and make sure that they were obeying the rules laid down by the 1834 Act. The letter explains why the Union was paying outdoor relief to people living outside the workhouse which was not encouraged. Wages are given in pounds and shillings.</b></td>

            7) Jal Harman (27) wife (29) and three children. Wages 12/s per week. 
            Allowed a pair of shoes.<br>
            Both the man and his wife are frequently out of health although not 
            returned as disabled they were known to the Guardians to have been 
            much distressed at the time.
            <p>8) John Brown (36) wife (33) and six children under 13. Wages 15/s 
              per week. James 2/s and has also half an acre of land. Allowed 10/s 
              for a nurse for wife.This man had been unwell for some time before 
              and had been out of work and lost time by moving from one residence 
              to another.</p>
            <p>9) Amey Harman (19). Allowed 2/s per week for her bastard child<br>
              This allowance was merely made a few weeks before the Sessions to 
              enable<br>
              the Guardians to apply for an order on the reputed father and which 
              order was made at the last Michelmas Session. The allowance will 
              therefore be received back under the order.</p>
            <p>10) Thomas King (49) living at Nuffield. Bill for &pound;3 for 
              medical attendance &#8211; this is allowed. If the medical officer 
              of the Union had attended to this case no expense would have been 
              incurred. In this case the man broke his leg and was taken to the 
              Public House at Nuffield. The Bill for &pound;3 was not for medical 
              relief, he having been attended by the medical officer of the Union, 
              but it was the bill of the landlord at the Public House for Board 
              and lodging and which bill was submitted to the Board at their weekly 
              meeting and allowed. He was removed from the Public House to the 
              Union Workhouse the first moment the medical officer could certify 
              that he might be removed.</p>
            <p>11) Thomas warren (48) wife (44) and six children all at home (eldest 
              14). This mans wages 18/s per week - allowed 10/s for one week. 
              This allowance was made in consequence of the illness of the man 
              who had thereby been deprived of part of his usual earnings.</p>
            <p>12) Ambrose Knight (44) wife (40) and six children under 12. Wages 
              12/s per week although only sometimes - unable to work. He is allowed 
              regularly 3s/2d per week. The permanent relief is ordered to be 
              taken off and his case will in future be brought forward when he 
              is unable to work<br>
