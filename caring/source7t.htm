            Reigate Union Workhouse: visit of Mr. Pigott, 12/2/1851
            <p>1) Date of last previous visit? <br>
              22nd August, 1851</p>
            <p>2) Is the workhouse generally adequate to the wants of the Union 
              in respect of size and internal arrangements?<br>
              Yes, in both respects.</p>
            <p>3) Is the provision for the sick and for infectious cases sufficient? 
              Are the receiving wards in a proper state?<br>
              Yes, there is a district hospital and fever wards. The receiving 
              wards are now in the process of alteration.</p>
            <p>4) Is the Workhouse School well managed?<br>
              Yes, there are but few children of either sex as compared with the 
              population of the Union and much attention is given to their industrial 
              instruction.</p>
            <p>13) Has any marked change taken place in the state of the Workhouse, 
              the number of the inmates, or the general condition of the union, 
              since your last visit?<br>
              There is generally full employment for rural labourers at this time 
              at good wages from 10/s to 12/s per week. But there are not withstanding 
              an unusual number of the more able chaps in the workhouse- almost 
              all however single men of loose character. This has arisen in great 
              measure from the abolition of the practice which prevailed in all 
              previous winters of giving able men out relief on the condition 
              of coming to the workhouse to perform an allotted task of work vid: 
              former correspondence.</p>
            <p>14) Observations not falling under any of the previous heads. Attended 
              a special meeting of the Board of Guardians called to consider the 
              report of a Committee appointed to enquire into certain charges 
              made against the Master and Matron of the Workhouse-viz-that the 
              Master had been in the habit of curtailing the quantities of bread 
              allowed to adults in the dietary without appraising the Governors 
              thereof, that the Matron had neglected to make visits to the Infirmary 
              required by the Regulations of the Poor Law and had not sufficiently 
              attended to the regular supply of clean clothing. Further that the 
              overbearing conduct and violent tempers of the Master and Matron 
              (more than once brought before the Board of Governors) was so intolerable 
              to the other officers that constant and immediate changes resulted 
              thereforth after a full consideration of these matters it was resolved 
              that the Master and Matron should be called on to resign, and to 
              signify this reply at the next meeting of the Board of Governors 
              when this resolution is sent to the Poor Law Board. I should wish 
              to make some remarks there upon. There is no suspicion or imputation 
              of fraud on the part of the Master who is in many respects an excellent 
              officer. The infirmity of the paupers is chiefly attributable to 
              the Matron.</p>
