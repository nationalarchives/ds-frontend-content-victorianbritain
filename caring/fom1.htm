        </h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">Edwin 
        Chadwick was the man behind the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. He wanted 
        to create a new system of poor relief, where people were trained to help 
        themselves. He believed that the existing systems encouraged laziness 
        by simply handing out money every week.<br>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">Chadwick 
        intended that workhouses should offer education and training for young 
        and old, but unfortunately his aims were misunderstood by many people, 
        including some assistant Poor Law Commissioners; these were the men who 
        were given the task of inspecting workhouses and making sure that they 
        obeyed the regulations. They often believed that the main aim of the New 
        Poor Law was simply to save money and punish the poor. Consequently, there 
        were many examples of early workhouses being run as cheaply as possible. 
        The result was that the poor were very badly treated. The most famous 
        example of this was the Andover Scandal of 1846 where inmates fought over 
        bones and gristle.<br>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="330000">It 
        was the fact that many of the poor in workhouses were so unhealthy, that 
        encouraged Chadwick to investigate the public health in towns. This led 
        him to publish his report in 1842. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;
